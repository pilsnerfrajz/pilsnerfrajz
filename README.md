## Hi, my name is William and I'm studying IT at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/social/program/cinte/)!

I mostly code in Java, but have some experience with C and Assembly, SQL as well as functional programming in Elixir and Prolog.  

## Current projects
I'm currently developing a "banking application", combining elements of different courses given at KTH. The project involves:
* a Java GUI using Java Swing
* connecting to a server over TCP
* executing transactions on the server using the SQLite C interface

The current progress can be found [here](https://github.com/pilsnerfrajz/Breadbank).
