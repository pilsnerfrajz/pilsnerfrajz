## Hi, my name is William and I'm studying IT at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/social/program/cinte/).

I'm currently developing a "Banking application" combining elements of different courses given at KTH. The project involves:
* a Java GUI using Java Swing
* connecting to a server using TCP
* executing transactions on the server using the SQLite C interface
